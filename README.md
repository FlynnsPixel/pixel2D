# pxl2D
PXL2D is a 2D rendering library that can be built on top of any c++ framework, such as SDL.

The aim of PXL2D is to support fast GPU multi-platform rendering with the support of batching, texture regions and more.

Development of PXL2D is very early right now, so features will slowly be added over time.
