# pxl2D
pxl2D is a (soon to be cross-platform) 2D game engine written in c++. The aim of pxl2D is to provide as much functionality as possible so you can focus on your game rather than how you will implement various technical solutions.

##Note
This project was a personal project of mine developed while I was still heavily learning c++, so it's pretty messy and the best practises and techniques are not present in a lot of the code, so I've decided to post-pone it until I'm more experienced to take on a project like this.
